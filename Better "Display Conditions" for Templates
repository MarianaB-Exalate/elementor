When creating a template, I would like to have more options for display rules.
Like "current URL" -> "contains"/ "does not contain"/ "exactly matches" etc

Nowadays, we have around 40 pages, that should not contain the navbar or the footer. 
I need to add them all manually, one by one, as they cannot be the "child" of any other page.
They are not blog posts, so I cannot add a category to them.

Thank you.
